This repository is dedicated to [Atari][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari] 8-bit computers. All the files (except this one) use the native encoding: [ATASCII][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATASCII] for text, [6502C][https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502] machine code for binary.

The [Action!][https://atariwiki.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Action#section-Action-OriginalCARImages] Integrated Development Environment is required to compile the **.ACT** files (using the [SpartaDOS X][https://atariwiki.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SpartaDosXReview] Operating System due to directory structure).

All code is written and tested on a **real** Atari 800 XL with [U1MB][https://lotharek.pl/productdetail.php?id=56] and [Side2][https://retrolemon.co.uk/atari-8bit-storage-devices/20-side2-cartridge.html].

Recommended version:
- U1MB with Side2 PBI BIOS 4.20
- SpartaDOS X 4.49e
- Action! 3.7X build Sun 29 Oct 2023

FujiNet can be particularly useful for loading files directly from GitHub (especially for libraries) to always have the latest versions.

Source files from other authors (Clinton Parker, Thomas Cherryhomes, ...) may be present (because they are used). The file header then includes the identification information and the conditions of use.

If you have any working Atari 8-bit gear that's cluttering up your space (and you want to get rid of it), let me know. It might help.
